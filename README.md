This repository contains the starter code for [Lab 3: Robot Programming 1 - Hello Misty](https://classes.cs.uchicago.edu/archive/2025/spring/20630-1/lab_03_hello_misty.html) for the University of Chicago course [CMSC 20630/30630 Human-Robot Interaction: Research and Practice](https://classes.cs.uchicago.edu/archive/2025/spring/20630-1/index.html) taught by Dr. Sarah Sebo in Spring 2025. 

The learning goals for this lab are: 
- Students will learn how to connect to the Misty robot and program robot behaviors from their laptop using Python and the Misty Python SDK.
- Students will gain experience programming the Misty robot's verbal and nonverbal behaviors by writing a program where the robot introduces itself to a new user.
